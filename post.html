                        <p>In Nauvoo, Illinois the Lord revealed truths and practices that continue to guide the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints today. His revelations to the Prophet Joseph Smith included the founding of the Relief Society, the practice of baptism and confirmation for the dead, and temple marriage. The Lord inspired Joseph Smith to confer priesthood keys on the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, preparing them to lead the Church when he died.</p>
                        <p>In 1839, Church members had begun gathering in Illinois after persecution forced them to leave their homes in Missouri and Ohio. In August 1840, Joseph Smith and the First Presidency formally announced the decision to build another temple. Despite the fact that the Saints had been forced to leave the Kirtland Temple behind and abandon two temple-building projects in Missouri, they unanimously accepted the proposal to build a temple and began to excavate the foundations.</p>
                        <p>In June 1844, work on the temple came to a stop when the Saints learned of the death of the Prophet Joseph Smith. Within weeks, however, building recommenced and even intensified as Church members labored fervently to complete the structure so they could receive the promised temple blessings. Unfortunately, pressure from enemies of the Church made it apparent that the Saints would soon have to leave Nauvoo. In September 1845, Church leaders decided they would abandon their temple the next spring. Brigham Young had planned to leave Nauvoo on February 4, 1846, but he saw a large crowd of people waiting to receive their endowments. He delayed his departure for two weeks in order to serve them. Temple records reveal that more than 6,000 Saints were able to receive their temple endowment before leaving Nauvoo. In October 1845, Brigham Young and the Quorum of the Twelve decided to sell the temple. They appointed three trustees to carry out the sale of the temple and other Church property in Nauvoo. The temple was advertised as being “admirably designed for Literary and Religious Purposes.” Ultimately the Church received no payment for the temple, and the three trustees left Nauvoo to join the Saints in the Great Basin. On October 9, 1848, fire destroyed the temple.</p>
                        <p>At the April 1999 general conference, President Gordon B. Hinckley dramatically announced that the Nauvoo Temple would be rebuilt. At the cornerstone ceremony, President Boyd K. Packer said, “The temple was destroyed and burned, and the stones of the temple were scattered like the bones had been cremated, and the temple, in effect, was dead. . . . So the temple died. But now, this day, it has come to a resurrection. The Temple stands here again.” Now, the Nauvoo Illinois Temple serves as a symbol of the promises of the Lord to His people and a monument to the early pioneers who sacrificed to build it.</p>

                        <p>On June 27, 1844, the Prophet Joseph Smith and his brother Hyrum were martyred by a mob in Carthage Jail, located in Carthage, Illinois. The original jail has been carefully restored and is about a 30-minute drive from Historic Nauvoo.</p>
                        <p>At the time, Joseph Smith was the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and Hyrum Smith was the Assistant President.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Latter-day Saint scripture asserts that Joseph “sealed his mission and his works with his own blood; and so [did] his brother Hyrum. In life they were not divided, and in death they were not separated!” (Doctrine and Covenants 135:3)

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Nauvoo Masonic Lodge</h2>
                        <p>The Nauvoo Masonic Lodge (1841-1846) was the first Freemason lodge among the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Nauvoo, Illinois. The lodge was officially instituted on March 15, 1842. Hyrum Smith was installed as Senior Warden and Worshipful Master. Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon were initiated as Entered Apprentices, and the next day as Mason at Sight.
                            In July of 1842, the lodge was suspended after other lodges in the area complained that they were functioning against policy, having initiated more members than any other. The suspension was lifted in November that same year and then the lodge was divided into three separate lodges.
                            
                            On June 24, 1843, Hyrum Smith laid the cornerstone for the Masonic temple or hall in Nauvoo, which was dedicated on April 5, 1844.</p>

                        <p>On October 3, 1843 the Nauvoo Lodge and all other Mormon lodges in Illinois and Iowa, were formally dissociated due to ill feelings toward the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints within the Grand Lodge of Illinois. In reaction, the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints established an independent co-existent competing Masonic Grand Lodge in Illinois. The lodge, with the other Mormon lodges in Illinois and Iowa, continued as an active lodge until 1846. During the Nauvoo Lodge's existence, almost 1,550 men of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints became members. Among them was the first five presidents of the LDS Church: Joseph Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and Lorenzo Snow.</p>
